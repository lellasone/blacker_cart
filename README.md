# Blacker Utility Cart

![Image of project render](pics/Render.png)

This is the CAD repo for a new 1 ton utility cart. It's designed assuming
access to a welder and some other basic fabrication equipment. There are
a few nice features like a reversable handle and mount points for railings
and carry handles. 

This project ran afowel of COVID, and is thus on indefinite hold until we 
once again have cause to need a utility cart. In the mean time feel free to
use the design however you wish. 

## Making Changes

Solidworks files don't really play nice with GIT, so when you are making 
changes please use the "working" branch. Once you are done making changes
test the whole project before updatating the master branch with your changes.
