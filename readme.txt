A repository for blacker card CAD

Status: This project is on indefinite hold (what with the pandemic and having 
	graduated). The design is in pretty much of a final form though, and 
	I'd stand by it as a good starting point for a general utility cart
	build. 
	

Welcome, if you are reading this then you are most likely looking to help design
a new utility cart for blacker hoves. Welcome! In the interests of keeping the 
cads usable, there are a few things worth keeping in mind: 

branches: 
	When making changes please use the "working" branch. There's no good way
	to merge solidworks files, so make sure to ping the chat with what files
	you are checking out. 

	When you are finished with a set of changes absolutly feel free to merge
	them into the "master" branch. Before doing so do be sure to make sure 
	they open on another computer though. We want to make sure that branch
	is usable without any tweeking.
